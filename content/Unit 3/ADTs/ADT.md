An ADT (Abstract Data Type) is a data type (e.g. a set) that contains a definition, without containing an implementation. All operations on an ADT have a signature, denoted function: inputs → output. An example of a signature is add: set × element → set.

Basic ADTs include:
- set
- list
- array
- stack
- queue
- priority queue
- dictionary

Advanced ADTs include:
- networks
- [[Notation| graphs]]
- trees
