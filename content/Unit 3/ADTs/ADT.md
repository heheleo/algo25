An ADT (Abstract Data Type) is a data type (e.g. a set) that contains a definition, without containing an implementation. All operations on an ADT have a signature, denoted function: inputs → output. An example of a signature is append: set × element → set.

Basic ADTs include:
- set
- list
- array
- stack
	- Basic operations are:
		- push: stack × element → stack
		- pop: stack → element
- queue
	- Basic operations are:
		- enqueue: queue × element → queue
		- dequeue: queue → element
- priority queue
	- Basic operations are:
		- insert: queue × element × int → queue
		- pull: queue → element
- dictionary

Advanced ADTs include:
- networks
- [[Notation|graphs]]
- trees
