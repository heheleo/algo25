Proofs are often used to prove an algorithm will work for some or all cases.
## Proof by Induction
First, prove the first case. 
Then assume that the $k$th case is true.
Prove the $(k+1)$th case
## Proof by Contradiction
Create a conjecture that is the opposite of what you are trying to prove.
Prove that such a conjecture cannot be true as it creates contradictions.
As such the original proposal must be true.
