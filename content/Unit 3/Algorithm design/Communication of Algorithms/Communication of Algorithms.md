#### Narratives
they are descriptions of what goals

In general, the following structure is used for the narrative: 
• An opening paragraph that provides an overall summary of your major activities and achievements. 
• Detailed description of your project and its implementation. Such as reasons about which ADTs you selected and which algorithms you applied to achieve a solution. 
• Description of how ADTs and algorithms are applied. 
• A final paragraph summarizes the contributions described above.

#### Process flows
pseudocode/diagrams/graphs/flowcharts

Represents separate steps of a process in sequential order. 

Elements that may be included are: sequence of actions, inputs and outputs, decisions to be made, external influences, time involved at each step and/or process measurements.  

The actions of the processes also known as algorithms, functions and modules can be communicated to others using the language of pseudocode. 

#### scenario analysis
Scenario analysis is a process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called "alternative worlds"). 

Therefore, the scenario analysis, which is a main method of projections, does not try to show one exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents consciously several alternative future developments.

#### system maps
groups information together in hierarchies


#### concept maps
show relation ships between connected entities

A concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between information. It is a graphical tool that instructional designers, engineers, technical writers, and others use to organize and structure knowledge

#### prototype
make a smaller model of the overall ploblem

A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.

It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. 
A prototype is designed to test and try a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.

#### specifications
details of what criteria need to be met to solve the ploblem

A Requirement specification is a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. 

A Functional specification is closely related to the requirement specification and may show functional block diagrams. 

A Design or Product specification describes the features of the solutions for the Requirement Specification, referring to the designed solution or final produced solution.

#### interpretation
how does solution relate to the real world
