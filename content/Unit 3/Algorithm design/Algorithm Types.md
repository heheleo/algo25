### Brute-force algorithm
A brute-force algorithm is an algorithm that checks all possible inputs for a solution. Brute-force algorithms will always find an optimal solution, however they are very slow.

### Greedy algorithm
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that chooses the locally best option at every step. A greedy algorithm will be optimal if the problem satisfies two properties:
	**Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution consists of optimal solutions to its subproblems
	**Greedy Choice Property**: An optimal solution can be found by choosing the locally optimal solutions. Making a locally optimal choice does not prevent finding the optimal solution.

### Divide-and-conquer
A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into subproblems, where it then solves the subproblems, which can then be combined into a solution to the original problem.
