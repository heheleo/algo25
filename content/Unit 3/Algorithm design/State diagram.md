A diagram that provides an abstract description of a system's behaviour. Each node represent a possible state that the system can be in, and [[Directed edge|directed edges]] are used to represent transitions between the states.
## Note
The [[Study Design|study design]] briefly covers state diagrams, and has not provided a rigorous way to define or create a state diagram. As a result, be careful when using different types of graphical notations. Typically, nodes should always represent a state within the system.
