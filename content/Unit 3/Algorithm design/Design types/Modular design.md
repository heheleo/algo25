Modular design involves breaking a big problems into sub problems.
Group repeated instructions into modules
Group related actions into modules
aids readability as allows abstraction
allows individual testing

Also known as top down design

Can be applied to form
- data classes
- helper functions


Modular design can be done in multiple forms

### Top down design

Breaking down a system to smaller components, subsystems are futher broken down in layers to get base elements, which are then build as modules.
### Object oriented design

Model ADTs to represent objects relevant to the problem. Modules then facilitate interactions between these objects


### Differences
top down focused on breaking down the process

object oriented focuses on breaking down the objects

Eg, designing a building
top down: what should be designed, what processes need to be done
object oriented: what is the components of a building, how do they interact, what are the properties of these components, how are they formed
