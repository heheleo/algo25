*Not to be confused with the other traversal algorithm, [[Breadth-first search]], both having the initials (BFS).*

Searches according to the most promising node determined by some rule. 
## Examples
- A* search algorithm
- beam search (not in SD)
## Heuristics
Whilst searching for the next best possible option, rankings of the option to select can be done by using a **heuristic function**. This can be based on the nearest neighbour, the best direction, or a combination of functions. The heuristic function can be denoted $f(n)$, and is sometimes called an *evaluation function*.
