| Parameters            | BFS                                                                      | DFS                                                                                        |

| Data structure        | Queue                                                                    | Stack                                                                                      |
| Approach              | All nodes on the same level is traversed before moving to the next level | Prioritizes going as far as possible and then backtracks when no further path is available |
| Conceptual difference | Builds the tree level by level                                           | Builds the tree subtree by subtree                                                         |
| FIFO/LIFO             | FIFO (queue)                                                             | LIFO (stack)                                                                               |
