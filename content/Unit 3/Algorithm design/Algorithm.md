A process or set of steps to be followed to achieve an outcome or result.

**Finite** sequence of **unambiguous**, **executable** steps or instructions which if followed would **ultimately terminate** and give the solution of the problem

Must be:
- finite
- unambiguous
- executable
- terminates

Further exploration of its definition for Unit 4:
An algorithm must be a self contained set of instructions.
Can be expressed in a finite amount of time and space, and in formal notation.
Does not have to be deterministic, can incorporate random elements.
