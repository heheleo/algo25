A [[Graph|graph]] where each [[Edge|edge]] is a [[Weighted edge|weighted edge]].
## Representations
We can denote a function that receives a set of [[Edge|edge]] pairs, and returns a set of equal size that contains the weight of every edge respective to the set of edge pairs.

$$
E = \{\{A,B\}, \{B,C\} , \{C,D\}\}
$$
$$
w(E) = \{2,6,3\}
$$

This means that the AB edge has a weight of 3, the BC edge has a weight of 6 and so on.
## Weighted path length
The weighted path length of a [[Path|path]] is the sum of the weights of the edges within the path.
