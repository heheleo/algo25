A graph may be weighted or unweighted.

The [[Weighted edge|weighted edges]] are assigned values, and are notated using a function that takes in the graph's set of edges, and returns a set of equal lengh that contains the weight of every edge in the order of the input set.

$$
E : \{\{A,B\}, \{B,C\} , \{C,D\}\}
$$
$$
w(E) = \{2,6,3\}
$$

From this we can see that the AB edge has a weight of 3, the BC edge has a weight of 6 and so on.
