A [[Simple graph|simple graph]] where any one node has a connection to all other nodes. The complete graph with $n$ vertices is sometimes denoted $K_{n}$.
## Degree of one node
The degree of any one node is equal to the total amount of nodes minus one:
$$
Deg(N[k]) = |N| - 1 , \forall k \in \mathbf N
$$
## Number of edges
The number of edges within a complete graph is given by $$
n(E)=\frac{n(n-1)}2
$$
