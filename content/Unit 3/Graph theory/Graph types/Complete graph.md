A [[Simple graph|simple graph]] where any one node has a connection to all other nodes. The complete graph with $n$ vertices is sometimes denoted $K_{n}$.
## Properties
- if $n>2$, then it is always [[Cycle|cycle]] (contains a [[Cycle|cycle]])
## Degree of one node
The degree of any one node is equal to the total amount of nodes minus one:
$$
Deg(N[k]) = |N| - 1 , k \in \mathbb{N},k \leq|N|
$$
## Number of edges
The number of edges within a complete graph is given by $$
|E|=\frac{|N|(|N|-1)}2
$$
