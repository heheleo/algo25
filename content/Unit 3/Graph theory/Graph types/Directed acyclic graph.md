A [[Directed graph|directed graph]] that contains no [[Cycle|cycles]] ([[Acyclic|acyclic]]).

In other words, it consists of [[Node|vertices]] and [[Edge|edges]] with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop.[^1]
## Properties
- no [[Cycle|cycles]]
- [[Directed graph|directed]]
- vertices can be arranged in a linear ordering such that it is consistent with all edge directions.
	- for example, in a left to right formation, all edges will point from left to right.
## Example
An example of a direct cyclic graph (contains a cycle) and a direct acrylic graph (contains no cycles)[^2]
