A tree is rooted if there is a root node.

The concept of root nodes do not apply for undirected graphs, only directed graphs.
Not all directed trees have root nodes.


A root node is a node that has a path to every other node on the graph.
In that the entire graph grows from this singular node.

If a rooted tree were to be topographically sorted, the root node should always be either at the front.
