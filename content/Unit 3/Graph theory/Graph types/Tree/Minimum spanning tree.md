A [[Spanning tree|spanning tree]] from any [[Connected graph|connected]], [[Weighted graph|weighted]] [[Graph|graph]] that has the smallest total weight. 
## Prims algorithm
[[Prim's Algorithm]] is used to find minimum spanning trees of a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]].
## Example
A connected, weighted graph that has its minimum spanning tree highlighted in red.
