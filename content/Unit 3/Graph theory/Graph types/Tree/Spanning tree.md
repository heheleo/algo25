Recall that a [[Connected graph|connected graph]] contains at least one subgraph that is a [[Tree|tree]]. If the tree connects all the vertices within the graph, it is called a **spanning tree**.
## Properties
- If the graph has $n$ nodes, the spanning tree will have $n-1$ edges.
## Types
- [[Minimum spanning tree]]
## Example
A connected graph on the top, and the spanning tree on the bottom.
