A [[Graph|graph]] with [[Node|nodes]] and [[Edge|edges]], where there are no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

As other attributes and information are added onto a simple graph, it can transform into:
- [[Directed graph |directed graph]] when edges are given a direction
- [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] as edges are given a weight

It can also be a [[Complete graph|complete graph]] given that requirements are fulfilled.
