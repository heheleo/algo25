A graph where it is possible to move from any [[Node|vertex]] of the graph to any other vertex using edges of the graph.
## Bridge
A bridge is an edge within a connected graph such that when removed, the connected graph becomes two connected graphs (otherwise known as disconnecting)
## Properties
- will have at least one [[Subgraph|subgraph]] that is a [[Tree|tree]].
	- if the tree connects all vertices in the graph, it is called a spanning tree.
## Example
