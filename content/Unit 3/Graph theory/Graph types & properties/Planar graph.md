A [[Graph|graph]] that **can** be drawn with no edges overlapping.

Graphs may be already drawn with edges overlapping. If they can be "untangled" in a way where no edges overlap, then it is planar. Hence, the emphasis on "can".
## Example

## Faces
When a planar graph is drawn with no edges overlapping, a face is a bounded area between edges.

In the example above, the planar graph would have 3 faces, as everything outside the graph is considered a face.
## Eulers formula
Euler's formula states that:
$$
v+f=e+2
$$
where $v$ denotes the number of vertices, $f$ denotes the number of faces, $e$ denotes the number of edges.
