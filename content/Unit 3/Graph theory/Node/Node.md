Also known as a vertex, nodes represent some point of data. Multiple nodes can be connected together through [[Edge|edges]].
## Degree
The [[Degree|degree]] of a node is the number of edges it connects with.
## Handshake lemma
The sum of all of the vertex degrees is double the number of edges.
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n(N)}Deg( N[i] )=n(E)\times2
