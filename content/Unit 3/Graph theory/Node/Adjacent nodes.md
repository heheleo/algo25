Two [[Node|nodes]] are adjacent within a graph if there exists an [[Edge|edge]] between them. That is, the two nodes are connected.
## Mathematical Definition
If a pair of [[Node|nodes]] $\{n_{1},n_{2}\}$ exists such that $\{n_{1},n_{2}\} \in E$, then $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are called **adjacent**[^1]
