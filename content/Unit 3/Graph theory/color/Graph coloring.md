Graph coloring, is the processing of assigning colors to each node of a graph, where each node should have a color, and no adjacent nodes are assigned the same color.

This is similar to giving nodes "weights", but in this case giving each node a specific color.
Node coloring is often used in models that deal with conflict resolution (resolving a graph so that there are no conflict/overlap).
For example, graph coloring techniques can be applied to assigning frequencies to radio stations, scheduling club meetings, and coloring the countries of a map.
