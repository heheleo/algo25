  - Topographically equivalent

[[Graph|Graphs]] satisfy isomorphism if they have the same [[Node|nodes]], connections, and connection [[Weighted nodes|weights]].

**Isomorphic graphs are topographically equivalent.** However, as nodes may be positioned differently, isomorphic graphs can be visually different.
