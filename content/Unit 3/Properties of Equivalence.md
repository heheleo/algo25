The equivalence operator should have 3 properties:
- reflexive
- symmetric
- transitive
An operator is an equivalence operator if and only if it fits all 3 properties.


## Properties of equivalence relations
### Reflexive
An item is equal to itself
$A=A$
### Symmetric
The order in which items are compared do not affect the final result
If: $A = B$ 
Then: $B = A$
### Transitive
Equivalent items are interchangeable.
If: $A = B$  And  $B = C$
Then $A=C$
*As long as the compared items have a common equivalent, the compared items are equivalent.*
