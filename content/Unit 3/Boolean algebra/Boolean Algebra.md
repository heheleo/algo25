Developed by George Boole, he demonstrated that all [[Logic statement|logical expressions]] could be constructed using three fundamental operations:
- [[Conjunction (boolean algebra)|AND (conjunction)]]
- [[Disjunction (boolean algebra)|OR (disjunction)]]
- [[Negation (boolean algebra)|NOT (negation)]]
This was later implemented in electrical circuits and laid the foundation for digital processing.
## Order of Precedence
Similar to mathematical operations, Boolean algebra also has a "order of operations".
For Boolean algebra this is called the **order of precedence**: **NOT** > **AND** > **OR**. 

Parenthesis may be used to override these orders.
## De Morgan's Laws
- $\neg(A \land B) = \neg A \lor \neg B$
- $\neg(A \lor B) = \neg A \land \neg B$
## Truth table
[[Truth table|Truth tables]] can be used to show whether a propositional statement is true for all legitimate input values.
