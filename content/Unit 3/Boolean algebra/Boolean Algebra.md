Developed by George Boole, he demonstrated that all logical expressions could be constructed using three fundamental operations:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
This was later implemented in electrical circuits and laid the foundation for digital processing.
## Boolean variable 
A Boolean is a variable that can only exist with values of either True or False.
## Logic Statement
A logic statement is a statement that are either True or False.
These are often simple declarative statements such as "It is raining right now", which may be True or False depending on current circumstances.
## Boolean operations
The three fundamental operations are:
- NOT
- AND
- OR
### Order of Precedence
Similar to mathematical operations, Boolean algebra also has a "order of operations".
For Boolean algebra this is called the **order of precedence**.
The order is:  **NOT** -> **AND** -> **OR**
Parenthesis may be used to override these orders.
