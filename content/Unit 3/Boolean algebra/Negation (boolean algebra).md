| $$\text{not }A$$                        |                                                           |
| $$Â¬ A$$                                 | This is the most common way within logic. Read as "not A" |
| $${\displaystyle {\mathord {\sim }}A}$$ | Read as "not A".                                          |
| $$A'$$                                  | Read as "complement of A" or "A prime"                    |
| $$\bar{A}$$                             | Read as "A bar"                                           |
| $$!A$$                                  | This is commonly used within programming languages        |
