### Truth Table
A truth table is often created when there is a statement whose value is dependent on the value of other statements.

For example the statements:
1. Object x is green
2. Object x is a cube
3. Object x is green AND object x is a cube
Here statement 3 depends on statement 1 and 2.

A truth table iterates over all possible combinations of the independent statements to show what the dependent statement should be for each possible set of circumstances.


| X is green | X is cube | X is green And x is cube |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| true       | true      | true                     |
| true       | false     | false                    |
| false      | true      | false                    |
| false      | false     | false                    |
