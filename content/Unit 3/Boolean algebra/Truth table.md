A truth table is often created when there is a statement whose value is dependent on the value of other statements. It iterates over all possible combinations of the independent statements to show what the dependent statements should be for each possible set of circumstances.
## Example
For example, the statements:
1. Object $x$ is green
2. Object $x$ is a cube
3. Object $x$ is green AND object $x$ is a cube
4. Object $x$ is green OR object $x$ is a cube 
Here, statements 3 and 4 depends on statements 1 and 2, so displaying this in a truth table may be a good way to represent all possible outcomes.

| X is green | X is cube | X is green and X is cube | X is green or X is cube |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| F          | F         | F                        | F                       |
| F          | T         | F                        | T                       |
| T          | F         | F                        | T                       |
| T          | T         | T                        | T                       |
