The conjunction of a set of [[Logic statement|logic statements]] is true if and only if all of its statements are true. The symbol to represent conjunction is $\land$, i.e. given logical statements $A, B$, $A \land B$ is true if $A$ and $B$ are both true. It is read as "A and B", and the symbol is called a wedge.
## Relations to similar concepts
These concepts all share similar characteristics, but their field is intrinsically different:
- programming languages: use of ampersand '&', '&&' within control structures
- set theory: intersection $\cap$
