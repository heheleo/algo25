The crisis arose at the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery of several paradoxes or counter-intuitive results.[^1] 

When the foundational crisis arose, philosophical questions about mathematical truth was involved, presenting two main options for trying to avoid paradoxes:
- intuitionalism/constructivism: restrict logical rules for remaining closer to intuition
- formalism: considers a theorem is true if it can be deduced from axioms by applying inference rules, and no 'trueness' of the axioms is needed for the validity of a theorem
## Formalism
The mathematician David Hilbert was a known formalist, proposing the famous [[Hilbert's Program]] as a proposed solution to the crisis.
## Intuitionalism/constructivism
Not relevant to the study design.
## Russel's Paradox
(not in study design) a paradox that contributed to the crisis: X is a set of every single set that exists which don't contain themselves. If X does not contain X, it is therefore a set that does not contain itself, and must be a part of X. But X does not contain X.

> [!note] Russel himself uses the Barber Analogy:
> In a small village, there is a barber who shaves all the men who do not shave themselves, and only those men.Â Who shaves the barber?
> 1. If the barber does not shave himself, then he is a man who do not shave themselves, which states he must shave himself
> 2. If the barber shaves himself, then he is shaving a man who does not shave himself.
