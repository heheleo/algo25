Introduced by the mathematician David Hilbert, it is a significant effort to establish a complete and consistent foundation for all mathematics.[^1]
## Origin
It was a proposed solution to the [[Foundational crisis of mathematics|foundational crisis of mathematics]]. Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and to provide a proof that these axioms were consistent (i.e they do not contradict themselves).
## Statement
The main statements of Hilbert's program was:
- a formulation of all mathematics: mathematical statements should be written in a precise formal language and be manipulated according to defined rules
- completeness: all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formalism
- consistency: no contradiction can be obtained in the formalism of mathematics (hence addressing the crisis)
- decidability: there should be an algorithm for deciding the ruth or falsity of any mathematical statement. This is the [[Entscheidungsproblem]].
## Gödel's incompleteness theorems
Kurt Gödel showed the most of the goals of Hilbert's program was impossible to achieve:
- Gödel's first theorem: any consistent formal system powerful enough to do basic arithmetic, there will always be true statements that the system **cannot prove**.
- Gödel's second theorem: it is not possible to formalise all mathematical true statements within a formal system, as there will always be true statements that we cant prove using the formal system (using the first theorem)
## Link to Computer Science
- Hilbert's Program created the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]. It was later proved unsolvable by Turing and Church.
- Gödel's theorem unveils the fundamental limits to what any formal system can prove. This parallels with Turing's [[Halting Problem]].
