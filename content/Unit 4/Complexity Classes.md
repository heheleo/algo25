Complexity Classes are sets of problems that are related in complexity. The complexity classes used in Algorithmics are for decision problems (given an input, the algorithm returns yes or no depending on some statement).
### P (Polynomial Time)
P contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. P is a subset of NP.
### NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time)
NP contains all decision problems which are solvable by a non-deterministic Turing machine. An alternative definition is the set of decision problems where the answer can be verified in polynomial time. An unsolved question is whether P=NP, however it is generally believed that Pâ‰ NP.
### NP-Hard
NP-hard contains all decision problems where every problem in NP can be reduced to the problem in NP-Hard through a polynomial-time reduction. A polynomial-time reduction is a method of solving a problem $P_1$ if the solution in 
### NP-Complete
NP-Complete contains all decision problems that . It is the intersection of NP and NP-hard.
