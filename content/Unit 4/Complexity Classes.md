Complexity Classes are sets of problems that are related in complexity. The complexity classes used in Algorithmics are for decision problems (given an input, the algorithm returns yes or no depending on some statement).

## P (Polynomial Time)
P contains all decision problems that are [[Tractable problems|tractable]] - that is, the problem has a solution that can be found in polynomial time. Polynomial-Time problems are [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic algorithms]]. 
==The class P is a subset of class NP.==
$$
T(n)=O(n^k),k \in { \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup{\{0\}}  }
$$

$O(2^n),O(n!),O(n^n)$ do not count as polynomial time.
## NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time)
NP contains all decision problems that are [[Tractable problems|intractable]]. 
That is, the problem either has solutions already found and are verifiable in polynomial time, or can be solved in [[Deterministic algorithm#Non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] polynomial time (by random chance). 
These problems can be solved on a non-deterministic Turing machine. An unsolved question is whether P=NP however it is generally believed that Pâ‰ NP.
## NP-Complete
The set of all decision problems $X$ in NP for which it is possible to reduce any other NP problem $Y$ to $X$ in polynomial time. This means we can solve $Y$ quickly if we know how to solve $X$ quickly.
If any one NP-Complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can also be solved in polynomial time, meaning P expands to contain all of old NP.
### Examples
- [[0-1 Knapsack Problem]]
- [[Graph Coloring Problem]]
- [[Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)]] / finding Hamiltonian path
## NP-Hard
NP-Hard contains all problems in NP-complete.
NP-Hard problems are at least as hard as the NP-complete problems. 
NP-Hard problems do not have to be in NP, as they do not have to be decision problems. 
If problem $X$ is NP-Hard, there is a NP-complete problem $Y$ such that $Y$ is reducible to $X$ in polynomial time. 
A reduction is a method of solving a problem by converting that problem into an instance of a second problem which has a known solution, and using that solution to solve the first problem.
If any NP-hard problem can be solved in polynomial time, all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time. Some NP-hard problems are not even verifiable in polynomial time.
### Examples
- [[Halting Problem]]
- Any NP-complete problem is NP-hard.
