(also known as the imitation game) 

Created by Alan Turing in 1949, the Turing Test is a test of a machines ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to that of a human.
## Test
One person communicates separately with a machine and a person over writing, without know which one is the machine and which one is the person, and attempts to identify which one was the machine. If the person is not able to identify the machine, then the machine passes.

The results do not depend on the machine's ability to **answer questions correctly**, only how closely its answers resembled those of a human.
