## AI

Capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as:
- learning
- reasoning
- problem-solving
- perception
- decision making

If traditional programs use an algorithm and input to create a output. 
AIs 'create'/train their own algorithm given input and (most of the time) expected output.

## Machine learning
A sub-type of AI that "learns" from data to make predictions and classifications, given new information.
See [[Training with Data|types of machine learning.]]
## Research
It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment, and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximise their chances of achieving defined goal. 
## Examples
- web search engines
- recommendation systems
- virtual assistances
- autonomous vehicles
- creative tools
- superhuman play in strategy games
