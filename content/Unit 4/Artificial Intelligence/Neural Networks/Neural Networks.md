A subtype of AI that works by mimicking human neurons.
Think of them as many connected nodes in a giant network, each doing their own operation.
Training a neural network involves tweaking how these nodes process their inputs until you get a desired result.

The larger the NN, the more training data required.

Types of neurons include
- [[Perceptron]]
