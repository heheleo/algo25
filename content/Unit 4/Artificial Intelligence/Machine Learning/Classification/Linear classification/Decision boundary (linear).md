An abstract boundary that separates input/feature fields into different sections, and thus what output should be given.

In a 2D plane with 2 features, a decision boundary will take the form of a 1d line.

## Notation
The decision boundary is described by: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i} w_{i})+b=0$$
(Note, $b$ is bias)

For 2 features/2 dimensions, it is: $x_{1}w_{1}+x_{2}w_{2}+\text{bias}=0$, which may be rearranged into a linear line.
