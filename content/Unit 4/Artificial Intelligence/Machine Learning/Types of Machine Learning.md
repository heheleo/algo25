Two types: supervised and unsupervised
## Supervised Machine Learning
Uses labeled data to predict outcomes.
- has a target output
- learns by minimising error
- aim to improve prediction on new data
## Unsupervised machine learning
Uses unlabelled data to discover patterns and structures.
- works without explicit guidance
- only reveals patterns, doesn't know what the patterns actually mean. The algorithm is like "Hey! These data points follow a pattern, here they are!"
