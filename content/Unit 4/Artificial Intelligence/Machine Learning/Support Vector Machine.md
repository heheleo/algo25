(also known as SVM) a [[Types of Machine Learning|supervised]] machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary that separates different classes in the data. 
## Principle
The main goal of the algorithm is to maximise the margin between the two classes. The larger the margin, the better the model performs on new and unseen data.[^1]
