Heuristics are techniques that aim to increase the speed of finding a solution, sacrificing accuracy for speed. Heuristics give an approximate solution at a faster speed, however this solution may not be correct. For example, [[hill climbing]] only gives a locally optimum solution, and may miss a globally optimum solution. Heuristics are used for [[Limits of Computability#Soft Limit of Computability|intractable problems]], where a regular approach would be too slow to work. Heuristics usually provide an estimate of some value, for example the cost from the current node to the end node.

### Metaheuristics
Metaheuristics are higher-level heuristics that optimise the use of heuristics. For example, [[simulated annealing]] is a metaheuristic that optimises [[hill climbing]] to reach a global maximum instead of a local maximum.
