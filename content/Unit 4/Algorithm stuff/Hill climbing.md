Hill climbing is an optimisation technique that aims to find a better solution via incremental changes to the solution. If the new solution is better than the current solution, then the new solution is chosen and incremental changes are made to that instead. Due to this, hill climbing will approach a locally optimal solution (any small changes will be worse), which may not be the globally optimal solution. This can partially be solved through the use of [[simulated annealing]].
