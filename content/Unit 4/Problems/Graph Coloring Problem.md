The graph coloring problem asks for a [[Graph coloring|k-coloring]] of a given graph, if one exists.

The graph coloring problem is [[Complexity Classes#NP-Complete|NP-Complete]], and so currently there are no known polynomial-time solutions to the problem.



## Greedy: Sequential coloring
Order colors in a sequential order.
Color a vertex in the first available color in the sequence.
